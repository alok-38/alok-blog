# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2024-10-19

## Welcome to My New Blog on Web Development!

Iâ€™m excited to share my journey as I dive into front-end web development and explore the Astro framework to build this very blog.

I will document my learning experiences, challenges, and triumphs
along the way.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Enrolled in the Scrimba front end career path**: Got started creating the cake web-page.

2. **Installing Astro**: First, I set up a new Astro project and created a GitHub repository, then pushed my changes and successfully deployed the site on Netlify.

4. **Learnt about the basics of HTML and CSS**: More on that later.

5. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

6. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
